    <h1>Frozen Zabaglione</h1>

    <p>If you like regular zabaglione, you'll absolutely love this frozen zabaglione recipe. In addition to the flavor, you'll see what might be the best way to make ice cream without an ice cream maker. Quite often, frozen desserts not made with a machine can have a weird, icy, crystallized texture, but not here. This stuff is incredibly smooth and creamy. Serve it with fresh fruit.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
	    <li>⅔ cup dry Marsala wine</li>
	    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
	    <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
	    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
	    <li>1 cup heavy cream, cold</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
            <li>Whisk Marsala wine, sugar, egg yolks, and salt together in a metal bowl.</li>
            <li>Set the bowl over medium-low heat or over a pan of simmering water; hold the bowl with one hand using a towel or pot-holder, while whisking constantly with the other hand. Continue cooking until mixture is very thick and reaches the ribbon stage, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice and cold water. Remove custard from heat; set the bowl in the ice bath to cool completely, whisking occasionally, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk cold cream in a separate chilled bowl until soft peaks form. Fold into the cooled custard until just barely combined; do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a chilled airtight freezer container, press 1 piece of plastic wrap directly onto top of custard, and seal container. Freeze until firm, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
    </ol>
