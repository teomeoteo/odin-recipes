    <p>A simple dessert that people love! You can use anything you want in place of the toffee: sprinkles, nuts, cookie crumbs, or whatever! This is also really good with dark chocolate.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
	    <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
	    <li>4 bananas, sliced into 1-inch rounds</li>
	    <li>8 (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate</li>
	    <li>1 tablespoon shortening</li>
	    <li>â…“ cup toffee baking bits</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
	    <li>Cover a baking sheet with waxed paper.</li>
	    <li>Spoon a thin layer of peanut butter on top of each banana slice. Insert a toothpick through the peanut butter layer into the banana. Place banana bites onto the prepared baking sheet; freeze for 30 minutes to overnight.</li>
	    <li>Melt chocolate and shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching.</li>
	    <li>Cover another baking sheet with waxed paper</li>
	    <li>emove 2 to 4 banana bites from the freezer at a time; coat each bite with chocolate mixture. Place coated banana bites on the second baking sheet; sprinkle each with toffee bits. Repeat until all the bites are coated. Return banana bites to freezer until set, at least 1 hour. Allow bites to sit in room temperature for about 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
